### Resources:

* [Introduction to Python by "thenewboston" (Videos)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_)
* [Python tutorial (Text)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

In addition, you'll find the following resources on Object-Oriented Programming useful:

* https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
* https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-object-oriented-programming-part-1-7d5d06833f26
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709821/what-is-the-purpose-of-self

______________

### Instructions:

* You'll find a bunch of Python source files and test files.

* Each source file focuses on a particular Python topic and contains empty functions.

* Your goal is to implement these functions and pass all the test cases. The test files corresponding to each source file are prefixed with `test_`. For example, the test cases for `strings.py` are at `test_strings.py`

* If you are not sure how to implement a particular function, read the unit tests for that function.

________________

It is recommended to complete the drills in the following order:

* `strings`
* `lists`
* `branching_and_looping`
* `functions`
* `dictionaries`
* `classes`
* `file_operations`
* `mixed_bag`
* `recursion`

### Checklist:

* **Python3**: Use python3.6 or greater
* **git**: Commit your code after completing each drill.
* **PEP8/flake8**: Install `PEP8` and `flake8` linters on your text editor. Ensure you don't have any errors before committing your code.
